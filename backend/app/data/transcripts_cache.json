    "text": "sleep apnea is a condition that affects millions of people around the globe it occurs when the muscles of the throat relax during sleep which can lead to blockages in air flow to the lungs and pauses in breathing each pause can last from a few seconds to over a minute and can happen many times throughout the night when this happens a lot your sleep is disrupted obstructive sleep apnea mainly occurs in the throat which includes the area from the back of the nose and mouth to the voice box the upper throat is like a flexible tube that connects the back of the nose to the windpipe the size and shape of each person's throat is unique it depends on a person's body weight the size and position of the jaw the bones of the face that support this area as well as the size of the tongue tonsils and palate the muscles that line the throat are flexible and when you are awake they are important for swallowing and talking however when you fall asleep these muscles relax if they relax to the point where the space collapses less air is able to get to the lungs and body the body senses the decreased airflow and responds by changing the depth of sleep to open the airway most people do this without waking up and may not know this is happening at night however if there are frequent pauses in breathing or large reductions in airflow during sleep your sleep quality can be affected this can lead to less refreshing sleep and daytime sleepiness even if you got a full night of rest to help you sleep better your doctor will first perform a sleep study or polysomnography to measure the severity of your sleep apnea it is a non-invasive overnight exam that monitors how many times the airflow to your body is reduced because of sleep apnea a sleep study can be done in two ways first in a facility which is called an in-lab sleep study and second at home with a kit you bring home and set up before you go to sleep the sleep study is then analyzed and each study is scored to classify sleep apnea severity into normal mild moderate or severe levels based on the ahi or apnea hippopnia index your healthcare provider can help you understand what your sleep study results mean people with moderate or severe levels of sleep apnea are at risk for high blood pressure heart disease stroke memory issues diabetes and motor vehicle accidents but there are treatments available to help with sleep apnea you",
